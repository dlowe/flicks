# flicks

Builds a combined webpage of upcoming screenings from Portland indie/rep movie
theaters, with wide releases and non-film events filtered out. Runs locally and
uses **no LLM/tokens at runtime** — it's plain HTTP + parsing. (LLMs were used at
build time to discover each theater's data source and write its adapter.)

## Pipeline

`adapters → list[Event] → 30-day horizon → events.json (full cache) → filter → render → index.html`

- `flicks/main.py` — the registry (`SOURCES`, each `(theater label, callable)`) and
  orchestration. One flaky theater can't sink the page. `_health()` records a
  per-theater fetch count in `health.json` and flags a source that errored or went
  empty after previously having listings (≠ a theater that's legitimately empty);
  flagged theaters surface as a banner on the page.
- `flicks/models.py` — `Event` (title, tz-aware start, theater, url, poster, and
  optional `imdb` link where the source exposes an IMDb id).
- `flicks/render.py` — folds same-film/same-theater/same-day showings into one row,
  title-cases SHOUTING titles, and emits all rows as JSON into `index.html`. The
  page itself does the grouping (by date / film / theater), the "from today" date
  trim, hiding (per film, per theater, per weekday, per specific date) with
  ⌘Z/⇧⌘Z undo-redo and a flash on the restored item, a 🔗 per showing, a
  poster→IMDb link
  where an id is known, and an `.ics` export of the filtered set (built from each
  row's `starts` stamps, emitted as UTC; no server), and a **New** marker on
  showings you haven't seen yet — all client-side, so every view is available
  with no re-fetch. "New" is tracked at the showing level (`key|theater|start`)
  in `localStorage` (`flicks.seen`): a showing flags as New until it's been on
  screen ~1s while foregrounded, then it's marked seen; the set is pruned to the
  current horizon. First visit (or returning to find >50% of the in-filter slate
  unseen) silently baselines instead of flooding. `THEATER_HOMES` maps theater names to
  homepages, used for the name links and the "theaters covered" modal (opened from
  the page title) — which lists all covered theaters, even ones filtered to nothing.
  Palette follows the OS (CSS vars + `prefers-color-scheme`); filtering everything
  out reveals a small "The End" easter egg.
- `flicks/titles.py` — `normalize()` strips presenter credits ("X Presents:",
  "// Presented by Y") and a trailing film-format qualifier ("in 70mm", "(IMAX)")
  so a film isn't split from itself; used by both `filter.key()` and rendering.
- `flicks/filter.py` + `filter.toml` — wide-release / non-film filtering (below).
- `flicks/multiplex.py` — Cinemark now-playing + coming-soon → wide-release denylist.
- `flicks/imdb.py` — build-time enrichment (no key): resolves titles to IMDb ids via
  the keyless suggestion endpoint (year-disambiguated, conservative exact-title match)
  and attaches ratings from IMDb's official `title.ratings.tsv.gz`. Ids cached in
  `imdb_ids.json` (incl. negatives); ratings file cached, re-downloaded ≤ daily.
- `events.json` is the **full** in-window cache (unfiltered); the page is filtered.
  Re-tuning the filter never needs a re-fetch.

## Adapters — theater → platform

Each platform adapter is parameterized and covers multiple theaters:

| Adapter | Theaters | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `events_calendar` | Clinton Street; PAM/Whitsell | WordPress "The Events Calendar" `/wp-json/tribe/events/v1/events` (PAM: `category=screenings-experiences`, drops the Tomorrow venue) |
| `hollywood` | Hollywood | WordPress custom `event` post type (datetime in the title); poster + link from linked `show`. Links to the `/show/` page when its permalink resolves (verified with a HEAD — series-umbrella shows 404), else the affiliated Movie Madness `/show/` page (same org), else the per-screening event page. **Behind Cloudflare → uses `curl_cffi` impersonation.** Parallelized + windowed (~45s). |
| `cinema21` | Cinema 21 | Veezi-backed "Flicks" site `/api/movie/playing-now` |
| `omsi` | OMSI Empirical | Ticketure via `wp-json/omsi/v1/ticketure-events` (filter `venue_short == "Empirical Theater"`) |
| `filmbot` | Tomorrow | Filmbot `wp-json/nj/v1` (uses `_imdb_id`/`_tmdb_id` as a film-vs-live-event flag; `_imdb_id` also becomes the poster's IMDb link) |
| `formovietickets` | Studio One, Moreland, Laurelhurst, Academy | static `app.formovietickets.com/schedules/scheduleV1/L{rtn}.json` (no per-film deep link — interactive-only; a Title's `webSite` is often an IMDb URL → poster link) |
| `indy` | Living Room (317), Cinemagic (40), Kiggins (28, Vancouver WA) | INDY/Proludio GraphQL `api-us.indy.systems` with `site-id` header. `movies` is paginated (defaults to 10, and limits ≳1000 silently fall back to 10) → page with `limit`/`offset`. Keeps only published, upcoming showings (the catalog spans years; drafts like Cinemagic's phantom "Up" are unpublished). Site-ids found via `{site(id:N){name}}` (no public hostname resolver). |

Not yet added: **5th Avenue** (Squarespace Events; showtimes buried in `body` HTML;
the theater runs on a summer hiatus so payoff is low).

## Filtering

Decision order per film: **allow > deny > non-film keyword > multiplex > cross-theater > density**.

- `filter.key()` is the loose matching key: lowercased, trailing `(...)` and
  accessibility qualifiers ("Open Captions") stripped, punctuation→space, leading
  article dropped. Merges `ODYSSEY`/`The Odyssey`/`Disclosure Day (Open Caption)`.
- Heuristics: a title at ≥3 distinct *tracked* theaters, or ≥6 showings/day at one,
  is a wide release. Tunable in `filter.toml`.
- **multiplex-subtract** (`multiplex.py`): the principled fix for wide releases that
  play only ONE of our tracked theaters (so no cross-theater signal) or are advance
  previews of not-yet-released films. Subtracts Cinemark's now-playing + coming-soon.
  Spares revivals by construction — old films aren't in the multiplex slate. This is
  why old wide releases shown as revivals (Iron Giant, Scooby-Doo) are kept; see the
  recency principle in this project's memory.
- `allow`/`deny`/`nonfilm_keywords` in `filter.toml` are the manual overrides.
- The page also has a per-film **hide button** (localStorage) for "not my thing".

## Conventions

- Hand-rolled, minimal deps: `requests`, `curl_cffi` (Hollywood only), `jinja2`.
  Stdlib `tomllib` + `zoneinfo` → needs Python 3.11+.
- All times localized to `America/Los_Angeles`.
- Run with `./run.sh` (~50s; Hollywood's per-show HEAD checks dominate). See README.md.
- `./render.sh` rebuilds index.html from the cached `events.json` + `multiplex.json`
  with no network (~0.1s) — for iterating on filtering/rendering. (= `python -m
  flicks.main --render-only`.) `health.json`/`multiplex.json` are gitignored caches.
